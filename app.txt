Welcome to the TechTonic Application Page!


Before applying make a note of the following directives:

Do not apply immediately after joining the discord.

Maybe hangout and show off some stuff on the server so we get to know you more as a player and a person.

Try to avoid posting pictures of farms and builds designed by others and instead show us some cool stuff you've designed.

Keep in mind that this is a technical server so stuff like megabases and shops are a no.

You can apply again whenever you want to.
